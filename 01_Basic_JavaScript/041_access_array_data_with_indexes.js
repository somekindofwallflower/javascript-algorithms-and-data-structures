// We can access the data inside arrays using indexes
// Array indexes are written in the same bracket notation that strings use, except that instead of specifying a character, they are specifying an entry in the array.
// Like strings, arrays use zero-based indexing, so the first element in an array has an index of 0.


// Task: Create a variable called myData and set it to equal the first value of myArray using bracket notation.

const myArray = [50, 60, 70];
const myData = myArray[0];

console.log("Fist element of: " + myArray + "is: " + myData);
