/*
After a value is assigned to a variable using the assignment operator, you can assign the value of that variable to another variable using the assignment operator.

var myVar;
myVar = 5;
var myNum;
myNum = myVar;

The above declares a myVar variable with no value, then assigns it the value 5.
Next, a variable named myNum is declared with no value.
Then, the contents of myVar (which is 5) is assigned to the variable myNum.
Now, myNum also has the value of 5.

// Task: Assign the contents of a to variable b.
// Setup
var a;
a = 7;
var b;

// Only change code below this line
b = a;
