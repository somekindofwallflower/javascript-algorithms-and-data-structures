// String values in JavaScript may be written with single or double quotes, as long as you start and end with the same type of quote.
// Unlike some other programming languages, single and double quotes work the same in JavaScript.

/*
Task: Change the provided string to a string with single quotes at the beginning and end and no escape characters.
      Right now, the <a> tag in the string uses double quotes everywhere.
      You will need to change the outer quotes to single quotes so you can remove the escape characters.

      const myStr = "<a href=\"http://www.example.com\" target=\"_blank\">Link</a>";*/

const myStr = '<a href="http://www.example.com" target="_blank">Link</a>';
