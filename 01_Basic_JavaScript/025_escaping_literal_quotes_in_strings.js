// In JavaScript, you can escape a quote from considering it as an end of string quote by placing a backslash (\) in front of the quote.

/*
Task: Use backslashes to assign a string to the myStr variable so that if you were to print it to the console, you would see:
    I am a "double quoted" string inside "double quotes".*/
