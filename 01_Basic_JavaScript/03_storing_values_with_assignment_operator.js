// Storing Values with the Assignment Operator

// In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the assignment operator (=).

/* First, this code creates a variable named myVar.
Then, the code assigns 5 to myVar. Now, if myVar appears again in the code, the program will treat it as if it is 5.
var myVar;
myVar = 5; */

// Task: Assign the value 7 to variable a.

var a = 7;
