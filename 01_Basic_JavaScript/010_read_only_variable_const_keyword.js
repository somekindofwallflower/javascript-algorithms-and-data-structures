// In 02_ES6, you can also declare variables using the const keyword.
// Declared using const are read-only. They are a constant value, which means that once a variable is assigned with const, it cannot be reassigned:
/*
Task: Change the code so that all variables are declared using let or const.
      Use let when you want the variable to change, and const when you want the variable to remain constant.
      Also, rename variables declared with const to conform to common practices, meaning constants should be in all caps.*/
